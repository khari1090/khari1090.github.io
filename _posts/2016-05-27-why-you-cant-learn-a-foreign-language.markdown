#Okay.

Here's the thing. It's not like it's crazy difficult or anything. Well it is. But it's not impossible. The problem is, you're simply not capable of learning a foreign language.

##Why?

Because you just can't. It's not a big deal but you just can't. I don't even mean to make you feel badly about yourself but learning a new language is unfortunately not for you. Other people can do it. I heard your little sister is pretty good at it. Unfortunately, you're just not. Genetics are a mysterious thing. Give up now and stop wasting your time. The end.
