#Learning a language is exactly like making a cake

So i’m sure you’ve all heard this one before, right? Okay fine, I made it up but still. Learning a language and making a cake aren’t as different as you might be thinking. Both require fundamental ingredients that compose the whole. Of course to learn a language you’ll need things like grammar, spelling, syntax and vocabulary as opposed to flour, eggs, milk, and sugar. Okay, you get the point.

Now, after you mix all of the necessary ingredients and give the cake time to bake (or time to practice - in the case of languages) you will have a fully edible (or speakable) product that is greater than the sum of it’s parts.

###How Important is your accent?

Lovely but not completely necessary is the accent. It's like the frosting on the cake. Oh, frosting. What a marvelous and tasty addition. It just makes the whole recipe a lot sweeter. Literally and figuratively.

The thing is, you really don’t **need** to have a proper native accent to be able to use a language and be understood. You certainly don’t need a proper accent to read and write in your target language.

In a lot of ways, having an accent can give you an exotic allure. I wasn’t a believer, myself, but it's true for me so I can see how when I first started learning French, my American accent was perceived as cute even though to me it sounded horrible. The same thing occured when I listened to my French girlfriend's accent. I thought it was cute and she hated it. If you're insecure about your accent, listening to native speaking children can make you feel like a real failure. When you compare your accent to the perfect native accents of children it’s enough to make you want to throw your arms up and quit.

Am I an expert on accents? Nope. But I was consistently confused for a native French speaker whilst living in Paris and that’s a pretty exceptional accomplishment considering how judgemental and critical the French can be. It’s not an insult either. How else could they have curated their reputation for refined architecture, cuisine, and style?

I am going to give you some of the tips I used to nail my French accent.

#How to improve your accent?

###1. Spelling
The first and most important tip I have for foreign accent reduction is **knowing how the word is spelled**. Particularly for languages like French, Spanish, and Italian (Romance Languages) the spelling and accents provide a reliable roadmap for pronunciation and once you understand the rules and patterns you can pretty much pronounce any word you can spell.

I wish I could say the same for the English language but unfortunately English spelling can seem entirely random at times. Often the spelling has little to do with the pronunciation. In fact, reading over the words I am writing now, I can imagine alternate pronunciations for many words without valid arguments why words are pronounced one way and not another.

The word “tomato” actually has **two** accepted pronunciations (the second one is standard in British English but is still frequently used in the United States):

  1. "Tomato" version 1
<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audio/tomato1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br>
  2. "Tomato" version 2
<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audio/tomato2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br>

So does the word “the” depending on what follows it:

  1. "The" version 1
<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audio/the1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br>
Context: "*The* reason why."
<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audio/the-reason-why.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>


  2. "The" version 2
<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audio/the2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br>
Context: "*The* only reason why."
<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audio/the-only-reason-why.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

See what I mean? To be honest English can be a little tricky. I'm not saying this is a characteristic unique to English but since English is my native tongue, it's easy for me to come up with examples like these.

**Funny/relevant story:** I was on vacation in Greece with a group of friends. While conversing, one guy, let’s call him Allen, mentions that “strawberries are the epitome of happiness.” Okay, that’s not what he said and I can’t even remember what we were talking about but the important takeaway here is that he pronounced the word “epitome” exactly how it looks on paper.

If that’s unclear, have a listen here:

**Incorrect**
<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audio/epitome1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br>

In reality, the word is pronounced like “epitomie/epitomy.”

**Correct**
<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audio/epitome2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br>

Just to be clear: I'm not hating on this guy. It's just a mistake. This is a native English speaker who has certainly heard the word "epitome" spoken before but could not make the connection between the spoken word and the spelled word. For Allen, these were two different words.

The moral of the story: English is tricky. Don’t feel bad about your abilities. Every mistake can make you stronger. Don't stop trying. Frosting is tasty.

###2. Memorization and Repetition

Memorization and repetition of phrases that you hear in movies and television shows. Sure maybe it’s annoying to rewind and play again and again but it certainly does help. Listen carefully and imitate. It’s without a doubt a parrot method and you can do it anytime you’ve got an audio recording handy.

Still not sure if you’re getting it right? Record yourself and listen to yourself. If you can’t hear it coming out of your mouth you can probably hear the mistakes in an audio recording. I know this is hard to do - listening to your own flaws but it’s a sure way to improve. Listen to the original, then you, then the original, then you. Re-record/repeat.

###3. Practice
If you have access to a native speaker, ask them to be extremely picky about your pronunciation and language skills. Promise them that you will not take their criticism personally. Assure them that after mistake number 34 you are not going to start crying, storm out, and end the friendship. When you’ve had enough you can always ask them to stop.

###Final Thoughts
Remember that the most important part of speaking a language is confidence and being understood. Fine-tuning your accent is just icing on the cake you’ve already baked. For some, the joy doesn’t come from the accent at all. Some of us are simply happy to have vocabulary and sentence construction. Others of us become obsessive about speaking like a native (I am guilty of this, myself).

**Things that might make this easier:**

  1. **Tongue and throat control:** can you roll your 'R's and gargle air with your throat? If you practice these skills in isolation, it will help you master the skills in context.
  2. **Musical ability:** would you say you have a sharp ear for music? When you listen to a song, do you listen to it’s individual parts or do you only hear it as a whole? If you answered yes to bot questions you should have an easier time speaking without an accent. Speaking has a lot to do with listening so a sharp ear for things like music can result in a sharper ear for details in accents.

###Observe

***Here is the story of how I discovered I needed to project my lips in order to speak French with a proper Parisian accent:***

I am the type of person who enjoys listening to music on public transportation. I learned while living in Paris that I could tell what language people were speaking (English or French) simply by observing the movement of their lips. Speaking French demands a strong projection of the lips to properly pronounce words like “où” or “le.” And it’s not like these two words are rarely used - they most certainly are. And these words are not alone in necessitating a strong lip technique.

You can exaggerate this at first and as you gain confidence you will begin to relax a bit.
